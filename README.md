# BBCodeParser

## About
This is a myCode/BBCode parser for Android.  I will be constantly updating and improving it and maybe adding some extendability
like being able to add your own tags to be parsed. At the moment you can pass any string containing myCode/BBCode and it will return 
a list of BBResult.  I will write a small tutorial on how to use it if needed, for now you can look at the unit test class to get
an idea of how it works.
